## Changing the website navigation

If you want to add a new page to the website, please add a markdown file with the content and edit `_data/navigation.yml` file to add it to the navigation menu.

## Editing team members

Use the `_data/team.yml` file to add/edit team members.

# Working on the website locally

The website folder contains `.devcontainers` folder that can be used in [VS Code Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/) for building the website locally in a Docker container, without installing Jekyll on your system. 

To build and view locally, open the `docs` folder in VS Code Insiders and run the `Remote containers: Open in container` command. This builds/runs a Docker container with a working Jekyll installation. Open the integrated VS Code terminal and run the standard commands to build the website:

```
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
