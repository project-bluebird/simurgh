## Running without Docker

This section describes how to install and run BlueSky and BlueBird withou using pre-built Docker images.

All instructions below assume one has cloned the `simurgh` repository along with all the submodels.
When cloning `simurgh` be sure to run:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 git@github.com:alan-turing-institute/simurgh.git
```

### 1. Install dependencies

All dependencies for BlueSky and BlueBird are specified in the `environment.yml` file.
To create a conda environment called `nats37` with all the required dependencies run:

```bash
conda env create -q && conda activate nats37
```

We can check BlueSky dependencies are OK by running `check.py` inside the Bluesky repository.

Running `python bluesky/check.py` will produce the following output:

```bash
(nats37) $$ python bluesky/check.py
This script checks the availability of the libraries required by BlueSky, and
the capabilities of your system.

Checking for numpy               [OK]
Checking for scipy               [OK]
Checking for matplotlib          [OK]
Checking for pyqt                [QT5]
Checking for pyopengl            [OK]
OpenGL module version is         [3.1.0]
Checking GL capabilities         [OK]
GL Version at least 3.3          [OK]
Supported GL version             [4.1]
Checking for pygame              pygame 1.9.6
Hello from the pygame community. https://www.pygame.org/contribute.html
[OK]

You have all the required libraries to run BlueSky. You can use both the QTGL
and the pygame versions.
Checking bluesky modules
StateBasedCD: using Python version.
Could not import pyclipper, RESO SSD will not function
Using Open Aircraft Performance (OpenAP) model
Successfully loaded all BlueSky modules. Start BlueSky by running BlueSky.py.

```

If the above command is successful, we can now install Bluesky into the Python path with:

```bash
(nats37) $$ pip install bluesky/
```

### 2. Run BlueSky

Bluesky can now be launched with:

```bash
(nats37) $$ cd bluesky && python Bluesky.py
```

The above command will start the Bluesky simulator with the in built GUI which
looks like:

![](/img/redsky-gui.png)

If one would like to run Bluesky _without_ the default GUI, a headless version
is available with the command:

```bash
(nats37) $$ cd bluesky && python Bluesky.py --headless
```

If one wished to connect the running instance to a remote host this
can be done with:

```bash
(nats37) $$ cd bluesky && python BlueSky.py --client --bluesky_host=1.2.3.4
```

This will skip discovery and attempt a connection to the specified host (using
the default ports).

Now that the instance of the simulator is up and running and connected to the
desired ports, one can now spin up Bluebird, which is the interface layer
between the simulator and the AI agents.

### 3. Run BlueBird

If Bluesky was installed successfully, then it should be as simple as running:

```bash
(nats37) $$ cd bluebird && python run.py
```

This should produce the following output:

```bash
2019-08-08 18:08:31 INFO     bluebird.bluebird: Connecting to client...
